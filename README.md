##  Project Description

This project analyzes the **Netflix Dataset** to uncover trends, insights, and patterns that can help improve Netflix’s **content strategy** and **global expansion**.  
The dataset contains **7,789 records** of Movies and TV Shows, including details like **title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and genre**.

By performing **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning**, this project provides actionable insights into:
- How Netflix’s content strategy has evolved over time  
- Which genres and countries dominate its catalog  
- Strategic recommendations for future content planning  

---

##  Problem Statement

Netflix faces intense competition from OTT platforms like **Amazon Prime Video** and **Disney+**.  
To stay ahead, Netflix must analyze its content catalog to identify:
- **Trends** in content types (Movies vs. TV Shows)  
- **Popular and emerging genres**  
- **Country-wise content diversity**  

This project aims to perform **Content Trends Analysis** and derive **strategic recommendations** for future decision-making.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of **Movies vs. TV Shows** over time.  
- Identify the most **popular and emerging genres**.  
- Examine **country-wise content contributions** and diversity.  
- Develop an **ML model** to predict whether a title is a Movie or TV Show.  
- Provide **data-driven insights** for Netflix’s strategic planning.  

---

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Inspection** – Import and explore the dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extract new attributes like year, genre, duration type, and country.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize patterns and relationships.  
5. **Trend Analysis** – Analyze Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, and country trends over time.  
6. **Machine Learning Model** – Predict content type (Movie or TV Show).  
7. **Insights & Recommendations** – Derive strategic findings for Netflix.
